Revision 1.27  1999/02/23 22:45:26  root
* Tested the Debian distribution stuff. Works after a couple of small patches
to the rules make script.

Revision 1.26  1999/02/23 00:06:25  set
* Added an example of how to change the desktop appearance. Contributed by
Joel <jso@europay.com>.
.
Revision 1.25  1999/02/22 23:04:30  set
* Included the debian directory for the debianization but yet not included in
the distribution package. Debian package by Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>
.
Revision 1.24  1999/02/18 02:41:34  set
* Compiled with djgpp v2.02 and gcc 2.8.1.
.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.4 released. Sources and binaries uploaded to DJ's server and my home
page. Linux sources and binaries uploaded to my home page (including a
dynamic version).

Revision 1.23  1999/02/16 00:33:56  set
* Added more information in readme.txt and fixed some typos.
* Changed the version to 1.0.4 because I'll release it soon.

Revision 1.22  1999/02/10 22:10:29  set
* Fixed a bug in the new terminals code for frames (I forgot to initialize
the array when we use the PC characters).
.
Revision 1.21  1999/02/07 13:56:54  set
* Added a "Try" button to the TColorDialog. It makes a redraw of the screen
and generates a cmUpdateColorsChanged broadcast. The broadcast should be used
by special classes that needs to know that the colors changed, the only one
I know about is my own editor that have a color's cache. This idea was based
on a crazy report by "a.meyer" <hexx3000@schaltzentrale.mvnet.de> ;-).
* Added a Uses_TColorCommands request for the cmUpdateColorsChanged located
in colorsel.h.
.
Revision 1.20  1999/02/02 23:03:19  root (set)
* Adapted the TEditor family to Linux (file I/O stuff and \r\n differences).

Revision 1.19  1999/02/02 01:55:54  set
* Added the TEditor, TFileEditor, TEditorWindow and TMemo classes. I taked
the code from the old RHIDE BETA 4 and adapted it for the new keyboard and
did other small changes.
* Added TEditorApp to the library and a small example to test it.

Revision 1.18  1999/02/02 00:56:55  set
* Minor changes in the readme.txt and porting.txt to give some hints.
.
Revision 1.17  1999/01/31 20:12:44  set
* Added support for S3 (buggy) BIOSes in vesa.cc. It helps to support VESA
text modes when using S3 boards. Reported and tested by Jerzy Witkowski
<jwi@pl.ibm.com>.

Revision 1.16  1999/01/31 19:20:14  root (set)

Passed the changes from DOS to Linux.

Revision 1.14  1999/01/22 01:05:37  set
* Fixed the UNIX terminals code to use the ACS_xxxx macros for the frames
instead of falling back to just ASCII. It makes the program look *much*
better when using xterm, gnome-terminal, eterm, etc.

Revision 1.13  1999/01/22 00:34:11  set
* Added clarification in the readme.txt about: license, RHIDE version needed
no-rtti stuff.
* Made the n() macro in tvutil.h visible only when Uses_n is defined.
(Problems reported by Jerzy Witkowski <jwi@pl.ibm.com>).
* Fixed the examples to avoid warnings about NULL redefined.
.
Revision 1.12  1999/01/19 22:54:22  set
* Fixed the gkey.gpr to be usable by anyone ;-). I added an rhide.env file to
give just another example on how to use it with TVision.
.

* Released the 1.0.3 version and uploaded to DJ's server.
.
Revision 1.9  1999/01/18 22:55:18  root (set)
* Copied the changes from DOS.
* Added the versions of libraries I use for Linux in the change.log.

Revision 1.10  1999/01/18 22:41:54  set
* Fixed the djgpp makefile switchs.
* Added code to the compress perl script to regenerate the makefile if the
it's older than the project.

Revision 1.9  1999/01/13 23:26:57  set
* Added "delete.me" files to ensure the empty directories are packaged.
* Silly boy, silly boy, I don't how but some silly options were included in
the DOS libtv.gpr (-funsigned-char and a -W that makes problems with gcc
2.7.x).
* Moved the #include of the standard headers to include these headers before
the C++ headers. If I don't do it default djgpp installations barf about
redefined NULL (no Linux libc5 nor glibc).
* Added instructions to workaround a bug in the gettext distribution for
djgpp.
.
Revision 1.8  1999/01/13 00:55:43  set

library.

Revision 1.7  1999/01/10 16:25:41  set

Revision 1.6  1999/01/10 16:04:05  root (set)
Added demo to the Linux distribution.

Revision 1.6  1999/01/10 00:47:21  set
Added the Borland's TVision demo. I taked it from the Sigala's port.

Revision 1.5  1999/01/09 20:13:10  set
Incorporated nine examples that implements various widgets. They are very
small applications so the user can see how a simple TVision application can
be setup.
.
Revision 1.4  1999/01/09 17:29:09  set
Changed compress.bat for a Perl script that generates the manifest and
version djgpp files and compress the files in the djgpp fashion. Asked by DJ.
.
Revision 1.3  1999/01/09 17:24:58  set
Modifications from Linux version.
.
Revision 1.4  1999/01/09 16:14:41  root (set)
Changed linux/compress by a Perl script that updates readme.txt (version),
generates the tarred files with the right version name and creates the .lsm.
(linux/compress)

Revision 1.3  1999/01/09 14:40:24  root (set)
Changed the Linux compress script to be much more efficient. Added a couple
of files to indicate files to include/exclude in the Linux distribution.
Changed the name of the Linux distribution to 'rhtvision' to avoid collisions
with the already existing tvision package by Sergio Sigala.

gkey.cc
Modified to support a command line switch that enables the new keyboard
mapping the old is the default because is the most common (Debian 2.0 and
Red Hat 5.1).

gkeyli.cc
Added TGKey::SetKbdMapping to support the new keyboard mapping found in the
kbd package shipped with Red Hat 5.2. Using
TGKey::SetKbdMapping(KBD_REDHAT52_STYLE) the new mapping is enabled. It
supports F1-F12, Shift+F1-F12 and Ctrl+F1-F12. Not only a special keyboad map
is needed but a special linux terminfo description is needed too.
If the program runs in console that's not needed but you'll get only F1-F10.

Revision 1.2  1998/12/30 01:01:12  set
Removed the redundant translation of the Linux IOCTL shift flags to BIOS
format.
Moved 90% of the conditional code to the Linux module.
Fixed the Linux code to report left and right alt.
Added entries to patch the right alt + function key, not only left alt.
Added Shit+PgUp, Shift+PgDn, Ctrl+Backspace and Ctrl+Space to the list of
patched keys.
