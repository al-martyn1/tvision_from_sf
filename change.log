Revision 2.35  2002/01/03 02:14:41  set
* Fixed: Need to create win32/rhide.env for Cygwin/MinGW targets. Needed for
RHIDE 1.4.9.
.
Revision 2.34  2002/01/03 01:28:38  set
* Fixed: getline code for BC++ 5.5 target. [lack of ssize_t]

Revision 2.33  2002/01/02 00:15:43  set
* Fixed: The configuration forced tvfintl for Linux.
* Fixed: RHIDE 1.4.9 includes rhide.env in generated makefiles so the new
makefile used for Linux needs a link to it in linuxso directory.

Revision 2.32  2002/01/02 00:53:16  set
* Added: GNU getline replacement to compatlayer.

Revision 2.31  2002/01/01 01:28:23  set
* Added: Code to avoid collisions between the last changes in tv/intl.h and
djgpp's conio. Note that gettext instructs users on how to change libc to
avoid such a collision.

Revision 2.30  2001/12/31 21:59:23  set
* Modified: Now if gettext isn't detected the configuration uses the fake
internationalization dummy. It can be disabled with --no-intl. Why? it allows
people to install gettext *after* compiling TV, they just need to change the
linker options and all works. Pointed out by Laurynas.
* Added: --force-dummy option. It forces the use of tvfintl even if gettext
is installed. That's useful when most of your TV applications won't use intl
library. I use it for the editor that I compile using their own gettext under
DOS, in this way I avoid using iconv.
* Added: Documentation about it.
*** IMPORTANT *** I don't include libintl.h anymore and assume the
prototypes. This helps with the dummy and I doubt it will collide. If some
day it collides the configuration could indicate how to solve it.

Revision 2.29  2001/12/30 23:34:07  set
* Fixed: A couple of new[]/delete style missmatches while debugging setedit
with MSS 1.2.1.

Revision 2.28  2001/12/30 18:35:46  set
* Fixed: Compatlayer undefined FA_DIREC even in cases that didn't redefine
it.

Revision 2.27  2001/12/30 18:33:33  set
* Added: Support for MSS 1.2.1 and fixed missing delete [] in demo. Patches
by Laurynas.
* Added: Configuration options to use MSS and documentation in the readme.
* Fixed: Various missing delete [] in the classes.

Revision 2.26  2001/12/30 16:15:10  set
* Fixed: I wrongly changed the code used for the BC++ 5.5 target to yield
the processor to use the MinGW version. It made applications eat 100% of
the CPU.

Revision 2.25  2001/12/18 02:34:11  set
* Added: Fine grained protection against multiple inclutions in compatlayer
header.

Revision 2.24  2001/12/17 00:20:32  set
* Added: A new URL to the Borland's FAQ that says TV is Public Domain. This
is supported by all the TeamB people I contacted.

Revision 2.23  2001/12/11 00:59:59  set
* Added: TDisplayDOS is almost finished.
* Added: Started to work on DOS mouse driver.

Revision 2.22  2001/12/11 00:26:45  set
* Added: Some adjusts to compatlayer for Cygwin target. Needed to compile the
editor. Patch from Robert.

Revision 2.21  2001/12/06 01:17:15  set
* Fixed: Some errors in listvi example. It used constant strings for input
lines (read only on UNIX and of limited size a disaster). Also fixed the size
of the columns and input line to be nicer. Reported by Wojciech Warczakowski
(Wowar) <wowar@poczta.onet.pl>.

Revision 2.20  2001/11/29 23:08:41  set
* Modified: Solaris have nl_langinfo so we don't need to use the
replacement. I didn't check if this correction works.

Revision 2.19  2001/11/28 23:41:26  set
* Added: getopt when Solaris is detected.

Revision 2.18  2001/11/25 19:07:33  set
* Added: TEditorApp dependency (TApplication) to the tv.h.

Revision 2.17  2001/11/25 18:46:44  set
* Modified: compatlayer.h should be included just once as tv.h, but this
isn't the case for all the applications and enforces a policy that doesn't
have to be the same used by other projects. For this reason I removed the
protection and any collision will be solved for the particular case instead
of protecting the whole file. After a talk with Andris.

Revision 2.16  2001/11/25 16:12:00  set
* Added: Some support for linux-* terminals. Patch provided by "Dimitar
Jekov" <jimmy@ncp.infonet.bg>

Revision 2.15  2001/11/25 15:44:29  set
* Fixed: Desklogo examples to work with anything different than 80x25 and a
lack of a redraw in tv_logo. Reported by Cesar Rabak <csrabak@uol.com.br>.

Revision 2.14  2001/11/25 14:59:58  set
* Changed: classes/WinNT to winnt, it avoids some problems.
* Compiled all the stuff to verify that I incorporated all the needed code,
it changed makefiles and other stuff.
* Merged Ivan patched for debian package 1.1.3-3, but they are outdated for
this new 2.0.0 branch.
* Added include/tv/drivers.h, it defines prototypes for all the drivers
entry points.
* Added classes/tgkey.cc, it replaces gkey.cc but is the abstract driver
base containing common code for all the platforms.

Revision 2.13  2001/11/25 00:41:41  set
* Added: Definitions for middle mouse button and also buttons 4 and 5.

Revision 2.12  2001/11/25 00:39:38  set
* Changed: call to new API name in demo example (to set window title).

Revision 2.11  2001/11/25 00:34:04  set
* Modified: TView because now the functions to set the shape of the cursor
are compatible with BTV 2.0 and not BTV 1.03. Also a change in an extended
member. The names of extended members changed to keep API coherence and
avoid pointer collisions.

Revision 2.10  2001/11/25 00:31:40  set
* Modified: TProgram because I changed the names of some members in TScreen
(all extensions not found in BTV) and to avoid using the magic "dual"
variable. That's temporally part of TDisplay but just to compile, it must
be solved in another way not yet fully defined.

Revision 2.9  2001/11/25 00:29:02  set
* Modified: TEventQueue::resume to avoid calling magic Linux functions, now
TGKey have a suspend/resume for it.

Revision 2.8  2001/11/25 00:26:56  set
* Modified: TColorDialog to avoid using the old getBlinkState function, now
part of the TScreen class.

Revision 2.7  2001/11/25 00:12:12  set
* Added the headers for the Linux and X11 drivers.
* Changed the screen.h, event.h and gkey.h headers to declare the new class
structure.

Revision 2.6  2001/11/25 00:04:03  set
* Changed classes/tdisplay.cc, classes/tscreen.cc and classes/thwmouse.cc
by the new class structure. This is a complete rework of the classes but
maintaining backward compatibility.

Revision 2.5  2001/11/24 23:56:50  set
* Moved gkey.cc, classes/tdisplay.cc, classes/thwmouse.cc and
classes/tscreen.cc to the DOS driver because they have the DOS code. They
will be changed to follow the new class structure.

Revision 2.4  2001/11/24 23:43:28  set
* Added: A new driver for X11, it is quite functional and complete.

Revision 2.3  2001/11/24 23:40:10  set
* Merged: New code for the Linux terminals. It's currently only one driver
(the mouse is the only exception) and should be split in three, but is
adapted to the new class style.

Revision 2.2  2001/11/24 23:21:19  set
* Changed version to 2.0.0 because big changes are about to be merged.

Revision 2.1  2001/11/24 23:18:11  set
* Added: X library detection to the configuration.

Revision 2.0  2001/11/24 23:12:33  set
* New change.log file created.
