Revision 1.5  1999/01/09 20:13:10  set
Incorporated nine examples that implements various widgets. They are very
small applications so the user can see how a simple TVision application can
be setup.

Revision 1.4  1999/01/09 17:29:09  set
Changed compress.bat for a Perl script that generates the manifest and
version djgpp files and compress the files in the djgpp fashion. Asked by DJ.

Revision 1.4  1999/01/09 16:14:41  root
Changed linux/compress by a Perl script that updates readme.txt (version),
generates the tarred files with the right version name and creates the .lsm.
(linux/compress)

Revision 1.3  1999/01/09 14:40:24  root
Changed the Linux compress script to be much more efficient. Added a couple
of files to indicate files to include/exclude in the Linux distribution.
Changed the name of the Linux distribution to 'rhtvision' to avoid collisions
with the already existing tvision package by Sergio Sigala.

gkey.cc
Modified to support a command line switch that enables the new keyboard
mapping the old is the default because is the most common (Debian 2.0 and
Red Hat 5.1).

gkeyli.cc
Added TGKey::SetKbdMapping to support the new keyboard mapping found in the
kbd package shipped with Red Hat 5.2. Using
TGKey::SetKbdMapping(KBD_REDHAT52_STYLE) the new mapping is enabled. It
supports F1-F12, Shift+F1-F12 and Ctrl+F1-F12. Not only a special keyboad map
is needed but a special linux terminfo description is needed too.
If the program runs in console that's not needed but you'll get only F1-F10.

Revision 1.2  1998/12/30 01:01:12  set
Removed the redundant translation of the Linux IOCTL shift flags to BIOS
format.
Moved 90% of the conditional code to the Linux module.
Fixed the Linux code to report left and right alt.
Added entries to patch the right alt + function key, not only left alt.
Added Shit+PgUp, Shift+PgDn, Ctrl+Backspace and Ctrl+Space to the list of
patched keys.
