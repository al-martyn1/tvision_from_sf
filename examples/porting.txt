Hints to port TVision programs to the RH port:

1) ushort dataSize()
This is unsigned dataSize().
* Reported by the compiler as wrong return value (gcc 2.8.0)

2) TListBox::getText(...
The second parameter was short now is ccIndex.
* The text doesn't show in the object because the code uses the not-overrided
  version.

3) TPalette isn't defined by default.
So you must add a #define Uses_TPalette.
* The compiler informs TPalette is incomplete.

4) const TRect& r
Most of the Borland code doesn't declare the TRect references as constants.
* The compiler barfs about a non-const reference.
