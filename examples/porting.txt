Hints to port TVision programs to the RH port:

1) ushort dataSize()
This is unsigned dataSize().
* Reported by the compiler as wrong return value (gcc 2.8.0)

2) TListBox::getText(...
The second parameter was short now is ccIndex.
* The text doesn't show in the object because the code uses the not-overrided
  version.

3) TPalette isn't defined by default.
So you must add a #define Uses_TPalette.
* The compiler informs TPalette is incomplete.

4) const TRect& r
Most of the Borland code doesn't declare the TRect references as constants.
* The compiler barfs about a non-const reference.

5) event.mouse.eventFlags & meDoubleClick
This doesn't exist, use event.mouse.doubleClick instead
* Compiler says that eventFlags isn't a member of the structure.

6) #include <tvision/tv.h>
The files in this port are just included with #include <tv.h>
* The compiler says the header can't be located.

7) Standard headers and DJGPP v2.01
Put all the standard (stdio, stdlib, string, unistd, time, mem, etc.) headers
before the #include <tv.h>. Isn't supposed to be needed with djgpp v2.02.
* Compiler complains about redefinitions of NULL.
