rhtvision (1.1.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Finally! RHTVision 1.1.3 is officially stable now!
  * There was an empty and useless usr/share/man/man3 directory on the
    package, now is gone.
  * Added compat/compat.mak to files_to_backup.
  * Remove generated linuxso/instlib on clean.
  * Don't remove linuxso/makemak.pl on clean.

rhtvision (1.1.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now compiles with -D_REENTRANT as Debian Policy mandates.
  * Now runs ./configure before make clean (reported by Salvador).
  * Don't eliminate the ldconfig invocation of the upstream Makefile,
    it seems that upstream has corrected its Makefile now (done after
    Salvador reported that it didn't work on all systems, because I was
    overwriting the Makefile while I was reading it, specially on
    multiprocesor systems).
  * Added include/tv/configtv.h to files_to_backup.

rhtvision (1.1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Upstream added a "buildpackage" script, I don't see the point of
    it but if it is of some use to Salvador or others, I will keep it.
  * Modified the new debian/buildpackage script to check before trying
    to do anything that it is being run from the right directory.
  * Simplified the backup system by using a TAR archive instead of
    copying and moving files around. Good idea from Salvador. At the
    same time now timestamps are preserved so CVS checkins are faster.
  * Uncommented out the binary-indep target, just in case.

rhtvision (1.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Upstream provides clean target!!! At last!!! Let's use it.
  * No more *.bkpdeb files on the distribution.
  * Upstream clean is not complete yet, so we still clean some files on
    our own.
  * Added to backup system: linuxso/compat.mak and win32/Makefile.
  * We delete the line containing 'ldconfig' on the Makefile, this
    causes a failure when compiling with fakeroot.
  * Added clean-debian to the .PHONY list.
  * Added Replaces: rhtvision-dev for more easy upgrades.

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Sun,  7 Oct 2001 18:18:56 -0300

rhtvision (1.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release!!!
  * Salvador (upstream) made minor changes to some descriptions on the
    control file and README.Debian for better description of the
    distribution issues.
  * Salvador also made small modifications to debian/rules to adapt to
    his changes of my previous patch for the -fPIC compilation of the
    compat library.
  * Now before building we backup upstream files that are regenerated
    and on clean we restore that files from the backups, so you can
    build, rebuild, clean, reclean and original files are maintained.
    As a plus this allows me to do a diff file for the upstream without
    hassles.
  * Now removes all .cvsignore files from the packages.
  * Added xlibs-dev to Build-Depends so that the library compiles with
    enhanced support for Eterm 0.8.10+.

rhtvision (1.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version! Rejoice.
  * Modified compat/ticks.c to include stdlib.h otherwise NULL is
    undefined.
  * Updated cleaning of generated files.
  * Support for compiling the compatibility library with PIC code (thanks
    Lintian for reporting this!).

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Fri, 10 Aug 2001 16:07:50 -0300

rhtvision (1.0.9-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Long time ago, this package (and other depending package) had to be
    removed from the Debian distribution because of yet unresolved legal
    problems with Inprise, fortunately the package had not been distributed
    with any official Debian release.
  * Slight changes to upstream source to make it compile on current
    unstable distribution.
  * Debian control file updated for new dependencies.
  * Standards version 3.5.2.0.
  * Do not use now deprecated dh_testversion, use a versioned build-dependency
    on DebHelper instead.
  * Made it clear that this is not an official package and that it is not
    redistributable (control file, copyright, README.Debian, etc.).

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Sun, 10 Jun 2001 19:05:26 -0300

rhtvision (1.0.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Standards version 3.1.0.
  * Added Build-Depends.
  * Architecture set to "any" instead of "i386 alpha" as requested by
    Roman Hodek. This library isn't tested on other architectures other
    than i386 or alpha, so, testing is needed and reports of success or
    failures will be apreciated.
    See bug 50319.

rhtvision (1.0.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't install manpage (symlink to undocumented(7) manpage).
  * Remove .cvsignore file in usr/share/doc/rhtvision-dev/examples
    directory.
  * Don't use install-stamp (in rules file) anymore, to avoid possible
    duplicate strings in maintainer script fragment files (see
    debhelper changelog of version 2.0.56).

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Mon,  1 Nov 1999 13:01:46 -0300

rhtvision (1.0.8-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upstream sent newer compilation scripts (bugfixes, enhancements).
  * Modified and bugfixed debian/maintainer.notes.
  * Now shared library package Conflicts: rhtvision1. This is to force
    the people who installed the previously broken library to uninstall
    that library and its programs and upgrade everything. Sorry.
  * Now rm -f linuxso/librhtv.so on clean.

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Tue, 21 Sep 1999 12:50:24 -0300

  * New upstream version:
    - Various bugfixes.
    - Various improvements.

    - Soname changes with every version (since every version is binary
      incompatible).
  * Now the -dev package depends on libstdc++-dev.
  * Architecture is now i386 and alpha.
  * Changed the name of the package from rhtvision to rhtvision1.0.8.

  * Not include debugging version of the static library anymore.
    If someone needs this, then tell me and I will include it again.

rhtvision (1.0.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * I don't use dh_installexamples anymore, since it doesn't work for
    me, instead I install the examples manually. So, there isn't
    anymore the /usr/doc/rhtvision1-dev/examples/examples directory,
    instead, there's only one examples directory.

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Tue,  1 Jun 1999 19:02:12 -0300

rhtvision (1.0.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:
    - Bugfixes.
    - Debian diffs incorporated on upstream source.
    - Renamed the name of the library from libtv to librhtv.
    - Some more classes added.
  * Standards version now is 2.5.0.0 (no changes).
  * Instead of doing the symlinks manually, now I use dh_link.
  * Now requires debhelpers >= 1.2.9.
  * Mention in debian/maintainer.notes that debian/rules should be mode
    755.

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Tue,  6 Apr 1999 22:24:13 -0300

rhtvision (1.0.3-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed postrm for rhtvision1-dev and rhtvision1, since it is not
    necessary.
  * Removed postinst for rhtvision1-dev since it is not necessary.
  * Packages checked with Lintian, there are some warnings yet...
  * Added maintainer.notes, gives usefull information for the
    maintainer (hey, thats me!).
  * I forgot about doing a symlink in the rhtvision1-dev package from
    rhtvision1.so to rhtvision1.so.1.0.3 (Lintian not complained about
    this!).

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Fri,  5 Mar 1999 16:04:23 -0300

rhtvision (1.0.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patches from upstream maintainer. Avoiding deleting some
    files that should not be deleted, added a clean-debian rule to
    clean Debian specific files, only headers files are copied from the
    include directory, and corrected the copying of files in the
    example directory (it seems that the author has some files there
    that don't need to be copied, dh_installexamples doesn't help very
    much...).
  * Made the clean target to depend on clean-debian, to avoid
    repetition of code.

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Mon,  1 Mar 1999 00:29:43 -0300

rhtvision (1.0.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * I don't remembered to add -lgpm on the upstream makemak.pl file.

rhtvision (1.0.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed some .ex files that never will be necessary.
  * Corrected upstream makemak.pl script to make a shared library that
    has dependencies, also added -pipe switch to gcc (little faster).

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Sun, 28 Feb 1999 22:35:57 -0300

rhtvision (1.0.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Lots of bugfixes and now it works.
