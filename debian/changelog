rhtvision (1.0.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * -v-0.1 Personal use unofficial version
  * Standards version 3.1.0.
  * Added Build-Depends.
  * Architecture set to "any" instead of "i386 alpha" as requested by
    Roman Hodek. This library isn't tested on other architectures other
    than i386 or alpha, so, testing is needed and reports of success or
    failures will be apreciated.
    See bug 50319.

  * Upstream sent newer compilation scripts (bugfixes, enhancements).

  * New upstream version:

rhtvision (1.0.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * I don't use dh_installexamples anymore, since it doesn't work for
    me, instead I install the examples manually. So, there isn't
    anymore the /usr/doc/rhtvision1-dev/examples/examples directory,
    instead, there's only one examples directory.

    755.

  * Removed postrm for rhtvision1-dev and rhtvision1, since it is not
    necessary.

  * Packages checked with Lintian, there are some warnings yet...
  * Added maintainer.notes, gives usefull information for the
    maintainer (hey, thats me!).
  * I forgot about doing a symlink in the rhtvision1-dev package from
    rhtvision1.so to rhtvision1.so.1.0.3 (Lintian not complained about
    this!).

rhtvision (1.0.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patches from upstream maintainer. Avoiding deleting some
    files that should not be deleted, added a clean-debian rule to
    clean Debian specific files, only headers files are copied from the
    include directory, and corrected the copying of files in the
    example directory (it seems that the author has some files there
    that don't need to be copied, dh_installexamples doesn't help very
    much...).
  * Made the clean target to depend on clean-debian, to avoid
    repetition of code.

rhtvision (1.0.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed some .ex files that never will be necessary.
  * Corrected upstream makemak.pl script to make a shared library that
    has dependencies, also added -pipe switch to gcc (little faster).
