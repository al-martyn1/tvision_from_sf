RHTVision for DEBIAN
--------------------
This is an UNOFFICIAL package and IS NOT PART OF THE OFFICIAL DEBIAN
DISTRIBUTION.
Send bug reports to me directly and NOT to the DEBIAN BUG TRACKING SYSTEM.
The original files are available for download at Borland's site and are
provided gratis. It still not clear if the sources can be redistributed
freely and we didn't get any reply from Borland's legal department.
